# Western US Geology Tour (Content Module)

**Overview:**
This repository contains the **narrative content and configuration** for an interactive,
cinematic map tour designed for the `maplibre-tour-control` plugin. 

**Content:**
The "Western US Geology Tour" provides a dramatic visual exploration of the tectonic and
geomorphic forces that have sculpted the American West. The journey covers a dozen high-level topics
and locations. It begins on the coast with the violent plate interactions of the San
Andreas and Cascadia faults, before moving inland to trace the history of explosive
volcanism along the Ring of Fire and the Yellowstone Hotspot track. The tour also
examines the  impact of water and ice—from the glacial carving of Puget Sound to
the cataclysmic Missoula Floods—and concludes with the deep crustal stretching that
created the Basin and Range, the Grand Canyon, and the Rio Grande Rift.

**Target Audience & Duration:**
This tour is designed for college level audiences.
While accessible to beginners, it utilizes specific geologic terminology (Flux Melting, Elastic Rebound,
Isostasy) appropriate for an introductory college curriculum. It takes approximately **10-15 minutes**
to complete at a leisurely reading pace.
