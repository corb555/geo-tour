<p>A chain of volcanic activity stretches diagonally across New Mexico: the <strong>Jemez Lineament</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a deep <strong>subduction scar formed 1.7 B years ago</strong>. When an ancient island arc collided with North America, it
    trapped water-rich minerals deep within the Earth's mantle. This "hydrous" rock melts more easily than the surrounding dry rock, creating
    a magma source waiting to be used.</p>
<p>Where this intersects the  deep fracture of the <strong>Rio Grande Rift</strong>, the crust is pulled thin creating an area that has allowed
    magma to break the surface repeatedly.</p>
<p>This line of fire strings together some of the state's most prominent landmarks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Valles Caldera</strong>. While this 13-mile-wide depression appears today
        as a peaceful, grassy bowl, its vast circular form reveals its true nature: a collapsed "supervolcano".</li>
    <li><strong>Mount Taylor:</strong> This massive, eroded stratovolcano rises over 11,300 feet, towering over the high desert.</li>
    <li><strong>El Malpais:</strong> A landscape of young, black basaltic lava flows and tube systems known as "The Badlands."</li>
</ul>
