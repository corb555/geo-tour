<p>This 13-mile wide depression is a textbook example of a Caldera. About 1.25 million years ago, a massive volcano erupted and collapsed inward.</p>
<p>Unlike Crater Lake, this volcano pushed back. You can clearly see the <strong>Resurgent Dome</strong> rising in the center, surrounded by a "moat" of lush green valleys. It is a perfect snapshot of a volcanic cycle frozen in time.</p>
