<p>The <strong>Valles Caldera</strong>,is a volcanic depression so vast that its rim forms the entire horizon.
    While it appears today as a peaceful, grassy bowl, its  circular form reveals its violent past as a
    collapsed "supervolcano."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this caldera is not unique. It is merely the youngest  of a <strong>sequence of
     calderas</strong> in the Jemez Mountains. They exist here due to the intersection of the <strong>Rio Grande
    Rift</strong> and the <strong>Jemez Lineament</strong>.
    This structure thinned the crust, allowing magma to punch through repeatedly, stacking one massive
    volcano on top of another for millions of years.</p>
