<p>Welcome to the stunning geology of the Western United States. While the ground beneath us seems rock solid, this entire region is actually a
    chaotic puzzle of colliding plates, stretching crust, immense forces, and hidden magma.</p>
<p>From the violent collision of the Pacific coast to the silent stretching of the interior deserts, we will
    trace the forces that built—and are still building—this continent.</p>

<p>The line slicing through the mountains  is the boundary where two massive tectonic
    plates—the North American and the Pacific plate—grind past one another.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Transform Boundary</strong>. The land on the left (West) is moving north relative to the land on the right.</p>
<p>But they do not slide smoothly. The plates are currently <strong>locked</strong> together by immense friction,
    bending the crust and building up tremendous strain. When the boundary released in 1906, the plate lurched forward
    up to 10m in some areas, creating a devastating earthquake.</p>

<p>Off the coast of the Pacific Northwest,  the ocean floor is being pushed <em>into and under</em> the
    North American continent. This is a <strong>Convergence Fault</strong> known as a subduction zone because the ocean plate is being pushed under the continental plate</p>
<p>This subduction builds up immense pressure, eventually releasing in Megathrust earthquakes. </p>

<p>The red marks you see, from Mount Shasta to Mount Baker— are the exhaust vents for the
    subduction occurring off the coast.</p>
Each peak sits directly above the point where the subducting
    plate dives deep enough to melt and then rise to the surface as volcanoes.</p>

FILE: 07_columbia_basalts.html
---------------------------------
<p>Long before the modern mountains rose, the earth here tore open. Massive fissures in the crust unleashed a flood of liquid basalt lava that
    drowned 63,000 square miles of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Flow after flow piled up, layer upon layer, until the ancient landscape was buried under a flat,
    frozen ocean of black rock **over a mile thick**. It remains one of the largest volcanic events in Earth's history.</p>

---------------------------------
<p>Millions of years later, towards the end of the Ice Age, an ice
    dam holding back massive Lake Missoula burst with the flood hitting peak rates of 20 million cubic meters per second.</p>
<p>A wall of water 2,000 feet high raced across the plateau ripping away the
    topsoil and gouging deep channels into the dark volcanic rock, creating the "Channeled Scablands."</p>
<p>This created the etchings of
    rivers that no longer exist and
    <strong>Dry Falls</strong>—the empty remains of a waterfall five times larger than Niagara.</p>

---------------------------------
<p>Lava and floods aren't the only sculptors here. During the last Ice Age, the <b>Cordilleran Ice Sheet</b> —a wall of ice over 3,000 feet thick—moved
    south from Canada.</p>
<p>The ice acted like a belt sander, gouging out the deep north-south troughs that are now Puget Sound and Lake Washington. The hills of Seattle are
    actually piles of glacial debris, littered with "erratics"—giant boulders carried hundreds of miles by the ice and dropped when
    it melted.</p>

        Why is there a 400-mile wide flat valley in the middle of the Rocky Mountains?
    </p>

    <p>
        50 million years ago, a continuous wall of mountains stood here. Then, the North American plate drifted over a stationary mantle plume.
        It didn't  melt the mountains; it <strong>obliterated</strong> them as a chain of super-volcanoes—<strong>
        Owyhee-Humbolt</strong>, <strong>Bruneau-Jarbidge</strong>, <strong>Twin Falls</strong>, and
        the massive <strong>Heise</strong> —detonated one by one.

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.4;">
            The <strong>Heise eruption</strong> was 2,500 times larger than Mount St. Helens, instantly turning mountains into dust and collapsing the crust.

<p>The hotspot that scorched Idaho now sits here. The central plateau of the park is actually a massive caldera—a volcano 45 miles wide.</p>
<p>The ground here breathes. It rises and falls with the pressure of the magma chamber beneath, powering the greatest concentration of geysers on Earth.</p>

<p>In Nevada, the Earth is being pulled apart. As the crust stretches, it cracks into massive blocks.</p>
<p>Some blocks tilt up to form mountain <strong>Ranges</strong>, while others drop down to form <strong>Basins</strong>. It creates a rhythmic landscape that geologists describe as an "army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico."</p>

<p>Here, the stretching of the crust has been taken to the extreme. The valley floor has dropped 282 feet <em>below</em> sea level.</p>
<p>High above, Telescope Peak rises 11,000 feet. If you removed the sediment filling this hole, the vertical drop would be nearly twice as deep as the Grand Canyon.</p>

    chasm <strong>20,000 feet deep</strong>.</p>
