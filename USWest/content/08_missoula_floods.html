<p>While tectonic forces built the foundation of the Northwest, the surface was radically sculpted by
the erosional power of <strong>Continental Glaciation</strong>.</p>
<p> Towards the end of the Pleistocene, the <b>Cordilleran Ice Sheet<b> formed a dam blocking the Clark Fork River, 
creating <b>Glacial Lake Missoula</b>.</p>
<p>When the ice dam failed, it released a megaflood with a discharge of 20 million cubic meters per second. This high-energy 
flow stripped the topsoil and created distinct channels (coulees) into the underlying basalt bedrock.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Falls</strong> is a relict feature of this event—a waterfall precipice five times the width of Niagara.</p>
