<p>Towards the end of the Ice Age, an ice
    dam holding back massive Lake Missoula burst, releasing a flood hitting peak rates of 20 million cubic meters per second.</p>
<p>A wall of water 2,000 feet high raced across the plateau ripping away the
    topsoil and gouging deep channels into the dark volcanic rock, creating the "Channeled Scablands."</p>
<p>This created the etchings of rivers that no longer exist and <strong>Dry Falls</strong>—the empty remains of a waterfall five times larger than Niagara.</p>
