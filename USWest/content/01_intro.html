<p>Welcome to the stunning geology of the Western United States.</p>

<p>While the ground beneath us seems solid, this entire region is actually a chaotic collection of colliding plates, stretching crust, and hidden magma.</p>
<p>To the west, the <strong>Pacific Plate</strong> is sliding past and crashing into North America, creating the San Andreas Fault and the volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest.
    To the east, the continent itself is being pulled apart, creating the deep rifts of the Basin and Range.</p>
<p>From the violent collision of the coast to the  stretching of the interior deserts, we will trace the forces that built—and are still building—this continent.</p>
