<p>At Death Valley, the stretching of the continent reaches its violent limit. You are looking at the gap opening up
    between the solid, rigid block of the <b>Sierra Nevada</b> (West) and the fractured, pulling-apart crust of
    the <b>Great Basin</b> (East).</p>

<p>The valley floor has dropped to 282 feet <em>below</em> sea level. But that is just the surface; the actual
    bedrock floor is buried under  <strong>8,000 feet of gravel</strong>. If you removed that fill,
    it would be a tectonic hole nearly two miles deep.</p>

<p>High above, Telescope Peak rises 11,000 feet. This vertical drop—one of the greatest on Earth—is active
    proof that the crust here is still ripping open.</p>
