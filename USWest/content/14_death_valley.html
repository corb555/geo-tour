<div class="tour-topic-label">Pull-Apart Basin</div>

<p>Death Valley represents the extreme of extensional tectonics. It sits at the interface between the rigid, granitic 
batholith of the <b>Sierra Nevada</b> and the fracturing crust of the <b>Great Basin</b>.</p>

<p>The valley is a <b>structural graben</b>. While the surface is 282 feet below sea level, data suggests the
bedrock floor lies beneath <b>8,000 feet of alluvial fill</b>, creating a tectonic depression nearly two miles deep.</p>

<p>This rapid vertical displacement creates immense relief. Telescope Peak rises 11,000 feet directly from the basin 
floor, evidence of active, high-angle normal faulting.</p>
