<p>The topography of the Seattle region is also a product of the <b>Puget Lobe<b> of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. During the glacial
maximum, ice over 3,000 feet thick occupied this basin.</p>
<p>The ice acted as an erosional engine, carving deep, U-shaped <b>Glacial Troughs<b> that are now inundated by seawater 
(Puget Sound). The visible hills are drumlins and deposits of <b>Glacial Till<b>—unsorted sediment left behind by the 
retreating ice margin.</p>
