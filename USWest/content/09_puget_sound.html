<p>Lava and floods aren't the only sculptors here. During the last Ice Age, the <strong>Cordilleran Ice Sheet</strong>—a wall of ice over 3,000 feet thick—moved
    south from Canada.</p>
<p>The ice acted like a belt sander, gouging out the deep north-south troughs that are now Puget Sound and Lake Washington. The hills of Seattle are
    actually piles of <strong>Glacial Till</strong>—debris left behind by the retreating ice.</p>
