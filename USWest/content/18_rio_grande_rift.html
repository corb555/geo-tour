<div class="tour-topic-label">Continental Rifting</div>

<p>The <b>Rio Grande Rift<b> is a rare example of active continental rifting. Unlike the broad extension of the Basin and Range,
this is a narrow, deep fracture separating the Colorado Plateau from the stable Great Plains Craton.</p>
<p>As the lithosphere stretches and thins, <b>Asthenospheric Upwelling<b> brings hot mantle rock closer to the surface. This
creates high heat flow anomalies throughout the region, powering geothermal systems and volcanism.</p>
<p>The rift basin itself has dropped dramatically; geophysical evidence indicates the sediment fill in the
Albuquerque Basin is nearly <b>20,000 feet thick</b>.</p>
