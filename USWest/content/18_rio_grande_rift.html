<p>Here, the continent is pulling apart. This is the <strong>Rio Grande Rift</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike subduction (plates colliding), this is <strong>Divergence</strong> (plates pulling apart). The earth
    dropped, creating a valley so deep that if you removed the sediment beneath Albuquerque, you would be
    in a chasm <strong>20,000 feet deep</strong>.</p>
