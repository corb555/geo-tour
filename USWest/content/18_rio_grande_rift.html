<p>In the Albuquerque Basin, the continent is actively tearing itself open. This is the <strong>Rio Grande Rift</strong>.</p>
<p>To the west lies the rigid <strong>Colorado Plateau</strong>; to the east, the stable <strong>Great Plains</strong>.
    The Rift is the violent seam where these two massive blocks are pulling apart. This is a <strong>rare geologic
        event</strong>—one of the few places on Earth where a continental plate is actively splitting.</p>
<p>As the land stretches and the valley floor drops, the Earth's crust thins. This allows the hot mantle to bulge
    upward, creating a <strong>heat anomaly</strong> beneath the state that fuels hot springs and volcanoes. If you
    removed the sediment beneath Albuquerque, you would look down into a fracture nearly <strong>20,000 feet
        deep</strong>.</p>
