<div class="tour-topic-label">Transform Plate Boundary</div>
<p>The line slicing through the mountains is the boundary where two massive tectonic
    plates—the North American and the Pacific plate—grind past one another.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Transform Fault</strong>. Unlike plates that crash or pull apart, these plates slide sideways. The land on the left (West) is moving north relative to the land on the right.</p>
<p>But they do not slide smoothly. The plates are currently <strong>locked</strong> by friction,
    bending the crust like a spring. When the stress becomes too great, the rock snaps, creating a major earthquake.</p>
