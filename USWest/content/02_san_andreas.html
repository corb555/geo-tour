<div class="tour-topic-label">Transform Boundary</div>
<p>The San Andreas fault is a classic example of a <b>Right-Lateral Strike-Slip Fault</b>. It represents the transform boundary
where the Pacific Plate moves northwest relative to the North American Plate.</p>
<p>Motion here is governed by <b>Elastic Rebound Theory</b>. The plates are not sliding smoothly; they are locked by friction. 
As tectonic forces continue to push, the crust deforms elastically—storing potential energy.</p>
<p>When the stress exceeds the shear strength of the rock, the fault ruptures. The stored energy is instantly released 
as seismic waves, resulting in major earthquakes.</p>
