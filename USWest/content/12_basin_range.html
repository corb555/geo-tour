<div class="tour-topic-label">Horst and Graben Topography</div>

<p>The Basin and Range Province is the result of <b>Crustal Extension</b>. Tensional stress is pulling the crust apart, 
causing it to thin and fracture.</p>
<p>This occurs along <b>Normal Faults</b>, where blocks of crust slide downward relative to each other. The uplifted 
blocks form the ranges (Horsts), while the down-dropped blocks form the sediment-filled basins (Grabens).</p>
<p>The total extension here has stretched the continent by nearly 100% of its original width, bringing the hot mantle 
closer to the surface.</p>
