<p>In Nevada, the Earth is being pulled apart. This is known as <strong>Crustal Extension</strong>.</p>
<p>As the crust stretches, it cracks into massive blocks. Some blocks tilt up to form mountain <strong>Ranges
</strong>, while others drop down to form <strong>Basins</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the flat valleys you see today are deceptive; they have been filled with sediment eroded
    from the peaks. If you removed that fill, you would see deep tectonic chasms.
    The mountains wouldn't just be 4,000 feet tall; they would be raw cliffs rising 8,000 to 10,000 feet straight up from the basement floor.</p>
