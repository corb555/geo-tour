<p>In Nevada, the crust is being pulled apart. This is known as <strong>Crustal Extension</strong>.</p>
<p>As the crust stretches, it cracks into massive blocks. Some blocks tilt up to form mountain <strong>Ranges
</strong>, while others drop down to form <strong>Basins</strong>.</p>
<p>The flat valleys you see today are deceptive; they're actually deep tectonic chasms filled with sediment.
    If you removed the sediment, the mountains would rise almost 10,000 feet straight up from the basin floor.</p>
