        The Snake River Plain is an anomaly, a 400 mile wide flat depression in the middle of the rugged <b>Rocky Mountains</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This plain marks the path of the North American Plate over a <strong>Mantle Plume</strong> (a connection geologists only
        realized in the mid-1970s).  Prior to 16 Ma, continuous
         mountain ranges stood here. As the plate drifted southwest, a sequence of <strong>Caldera-forming
         super-eruptions</strong> effectively obliterated the high relief, collapsing the crust into the
         low-lying plain visible today.

            The <strong>Heise Volcanic Field</strong> (6.6 Ma) produced rhyolitic eruptions 2,500 times larger than Mount St. Helens, burying the ancient topography under thousands of feet of ignimbrite.
