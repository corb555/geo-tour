        Why is there a 400-mile wide flat valley in the middle of the Rocky Mountains?
    </p>

    <p>
        50 million years ago, a continuous wall of mountains stood here. Then, the North American plate drifted over a stationary <strong>Mantle Plume (Hotspot)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It didn't melt the mountains; it <strong>obliterated</strong> them. A chain of super-volcanoes—<strong>Owyhee-Humbolt</strong>, <strong>Bruneau-Jarbidge</strong>, <strong>Twin Falls</strong>, and
        the massive <strong>Heise</strong> field—detonated one by one as the plate moved over the heat source.

            The <strong>Heise eruption</strong> was 2,500 times larger than Mount St. Helens, instantly turning mountains into dust and collapsing the crust.
