<p>During the Miocene epoch (approx. 16 Ma), the crust here fractured, unleashing a massive <strong>Flood Basalt</strong> event. This is
    widely believed to be the initial arrival of the Yellowstone Hotspot plume head.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to the high-viscosity eruptions of the Cascades, this was **low-silica (Mafic)** magma with **low viscosity**.
    It erupted from fissures in massive volumes, creating fluid sheets that flowed like water across the landscape. The resulting
    stack of lava is over a mile thick, weighing down the crust to create a distinct subsidence basin.</p>
