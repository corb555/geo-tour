<p>During the Miocene epoch (approx. 17 Ma), the crust here fractured, unleashing a <b>Flood Basalt</b> event. This is widely
believed to be
the initial arrival of the Yellowstone Hotspot plume head.</p>
<p>Unlike the high-viscosity eruptions of the Cascades, this was <b>low-viscosity tholeiitic basalt</b>. It erupted from 
fissure vents in massive volumes, creating sheet flows that inundated the topography. The resulting stack of lava flows 
is over a mile thick, weighing down the crust and creating a distinct subsidence basin.</p>
