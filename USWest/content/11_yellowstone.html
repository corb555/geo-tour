<p>The hotspot currently resides beneath the Yellowstone Plateau. The park's central feature is  a 45-mile
wide <b>Caldera<b>—a collapse depression formed after the explosive ejection of the Lava Creek Tuff (640 ka).</p>
<p>The system remains active, characterized by <b>Resurgent Domes<b> (uplift caused by recharging magma chambers). The
interaction of this shallow heat source with groundwater creates the world's highest concentration of hydrothermal features.</p>
