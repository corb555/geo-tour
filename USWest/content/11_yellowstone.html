<p>The hotspot that scorched Idaho now sits here. The central plateau of the park is actually a massive <strong>Caldera</strong>—a volcano 45 miles wide that collapsed into itself.</p>
<p>The volcano is not dead; it is sleeping. The ground here breathes, rising and falling with the pressure of the magma chamber beneath, powering the greatest concentration of geysers on Earth.</p>
