<p>The hotspot currently resides beneath the Yellowstone Plateau. Unlike the fluid lava that formed the Columbia River
    Basalts, the magma here is <strong>Silicic (Rhyolitic)</strong>. This high silica content makes the magma highly viscous,
    trapping gas until it detonates.</p>

<p>This explosive violence created the park's defining geological feature: the <strong>Yellowstone Caldera</strong>.
    When the massive Lava Creek eruption (640 ka) emptied the magma chamber, the roof collapsed, leaving a crater 45 miles wide.</p>

<p>Within this crater, the shallow heat source powers the world's highest concentration of geysers, while
    <strong>Resurgent Domes</strong> rise and fall as the magma chamber recharges below.</p>
