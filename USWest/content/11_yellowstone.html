<p>The hotspot currently resides beneath the Yellowstone Plateau. Unlike the fluid, low-silica lava of the Columbia River Basalts, the
    magma here is **High-Silica (Rhyolitic)**.</p>

<p>This high silica content makes the magma **extremely viscous**, trapping massive amounts of gas pressure until it explodes.
    This violence created the park's defining feature: the **Yellowstone Caldera**. When the massive Lava Creek eruption (640 ka)
    emptied the magma chamber, the roof collapsed, leaving a crater 45 miles wide.</p>

<p>Within this crater, the shallow heat source powers the world's highest concentration of geysers, while <strong>Resurgent
    Domes</strong> rise and fall as the magma chamber recharges below.</p>
