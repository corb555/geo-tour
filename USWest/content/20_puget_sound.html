<p>The topography of the Seattle region is also a product of the <b>Puget Lobe</b> of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. During
    the glacial
maximum (approx. 17,000 years ago), ice over 3,000 feet thick occupied this basin.</p>
<p>The ice acted as an erosional engine, carving deep, U-shaped <strong>Glacial Troughs</strong>. The visible
    hills
    are drumlins and deposits of <strong>Glacial Till</strong>—unsorted sediment left by the retreating ice. This
    retreat also dropped massive <strong>Glacial Erratics</strong>—house-sized boulders carried from Canada and
    stranded in random locations throughout the region.</p>
