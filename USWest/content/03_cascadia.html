<p>Off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, the ocean floor is being shoved <em>into and under</em> the
    North American continent. This is a <strong>Subduction Zone</strong>.</p>
<p>Because the oceanic plate is denser than the continent, it sinks into the mantle. This collision builds up immense pressure
    that eventually releases in <strong>Megathrust Earthquakes</strong>—the largest type of earthquake possible on Earth.</p>
