<p>Off the coast of the Pacific Northwest lies a violent <strong>Convergent Margin</strong>. Here, the
    dense, oceanic <strong>Juan de Fuca Plate</strong> is being driven beneath the North American
    continent.</p>

<p>This massive collision produces three dramatic consequences. First, it scrapes layers of marine rock off
    the diving plate, thrusting them upward to build the  <strong>Coastal Mountain Ranges</strong>. Second, the
    plates lock together, building immense strain that eventually releases in catastrophic <strong>Megathrust
        Earthquakes</strong> (Magnitude 9.0+), such as the great Cascadia earthquake of 1700.</p>
