<p>While deep tectonic forces built the structural foundation of the West, the surface topography was radically reworked by a much
    younger force: <strong>The Ice Age</strong>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Pleistocene (approx. 15,000 to 13,000 years ago), the massive <strong>Cordilleran Ice Sheet</strong>
    descended from Canada. A lobe of this ice
    formed a dam blocking the Clark Fork River, creating <strong>Glacial Lake Missoula</strong>.</p>

<p>When the dam failed, it unleashed a megaflood with a discharge of 20 million cubic meters per second. This high-energy flow
    stripped the topsoil and carved distinct channels (coulees) directly into the volcanic bedrock.</p>

<p><strong>Dry Falls</strong> is a relict feature of this event—a fossilized waterfall precipice five times the width of Niagara.</p>
