<p>The red marks you see—from Mount Shasta to Mount Baker—are <strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong>. They are
    the exhaust vents for the subduction occurring off the coast.</p>
<p>As the subducting oceanic plate dives deep underground, heat and pressure drive water out of the
    rock. This water melts the rock above it, creating magma that rises to the surface to form a
    chain of explosive volcanoes known as a <strong>Volcanic Arc</strong>.</p>
