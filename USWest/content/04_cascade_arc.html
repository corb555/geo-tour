<p>The third consequence of subduction occurs inland. As the oceanic slab plunges 60 miles into the mantle, it triggers the formation
    of the <strong>Cascade Volcanic Arc</strong>.</p>

<p>Intense heat and pressure drive volatiles (water and CO2) out of the sinking rock. This generates magma
    with <strong>intermediate silica content</strong> and <strong>high viscosity</strong>. This thick magma piles up to construct steep,
    explosive <strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong> like Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens.</p>
