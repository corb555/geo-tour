<p>The third consequence of subduction occurs inland. As the oceanic slab plunges 60 miles into the mantle, it triggers
    the formation of the <strong>Cascade Volcanic Arc</strong>.</p>

<p>Intense heat and pressure drive volatiles (water and CO2) out of the sinking rock. These fluids lower the melting
    point of the overlying mantle <strong>(Flux Melting)</strong>, generating magma that ascends through the
    crust to construct massive <strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong> like Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens.</p>
