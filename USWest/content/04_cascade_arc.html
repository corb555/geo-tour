<div class="tour-topic-label">Continental Volcanic Arc</div>

<p>The High Cascades—from Mount Shasta to Mount Rainier—are classic <b>Stratovolcanoes</b>. Their existence
    is tied to the
subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate which begins roughly 100 miles to the west.</p>
<p>This is fueled by <b>Flux Melting</b>. As the oceanic plate descends into the mantle, heat and pressure
    drive volatiles
(water and CO2) out of the slab. These fluids lower the melting point of the overlying mantle wedge,
    generating magma
that ascends through the crust to form a <b>Volcanic Arc</b>.</p>
